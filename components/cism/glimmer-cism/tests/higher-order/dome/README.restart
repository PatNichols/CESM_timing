These are instructions for demonstrating exact restart for the evolving-dome problem.

Assume the standard config file is dome.config and runs for 10 years.

(1) Create a file called dome.config.5yr.  Here is how it should differ from dome.config:

< tend = 10.
---
> tend = 5.
44c44,50
< name = dome.out.nc
---
> name = dome.5yr.out.nc
> 
> [CF output]
> variables = restart
> xtype = double
> frequency = 5
> name = dome.restart.nc

(2) Create a file called dome.config.5yr.continue.  Here is how it should differ from dome.config:

< tstart = 0.
---
> tstart = 5.
22a23
> restart = 1
38,39c39,40
< name = dome.nc
< time = 1
---
> name = dome.restart.nc
> time = 2
44c45,46
< name = dome.out.nc
---
> name = dome.5yr.continue.out.nc

NOTE: 'time = 2' means to read the second time slice, i.e. the time slice written at the end of the first run.
      Time slice 1 in dome.restart.nc contains the initial condition.

(3) Run the standard 10-year evolving-dome test:

> cism driver dome.config

NOTE: To test exact restart, we **cannot** use the Python script dome.py.  
This is because the Python script will replace the existing dome.restart.nc with a standard dome input file
that is called dome.restart.nc but contains only topg and thk as input.

(4) Run the 5-yr evolving-dome test, writing a restart file at the end:

> cism_driver dome.config.5yr

(5) Run the continuation test from year 5 to year 10:

> cism_driver dome.config.5yr.continue

(6) Compare log files (dome.config.log v. dome.config.5yr.continue.log) and netCDF output files 
    (dome.out.nc v. dome.5yr.continue.out.nc) and make sure results are bit-for-bit.
