This testmods directory allows interpolating non-crop to crop; this requires
init_interp_fill_missing_with_natveg since we have a new crop landunit that
doesn't exist in the input file.

Note: if we stop supporting out-of-the-box f19 initial conditions files, this
could be changed to f09 (or whatever resolution we provide initial conditions
for).
